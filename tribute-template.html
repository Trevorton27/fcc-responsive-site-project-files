  <p>In recent years His Holiness The Dalai Lama has become quite famous around the world as something of a monastic celebrity. This meeting of ancient eastern tradition and online, 24/7 pop-culture is entirely unprecedented.  Today, we can hear mention of the Dalai Lama or even see his picture or him talking on the television only to be followed immediately by a commercial for Mcdonalds or an update on some bizarre celeberity of the week drama. Yes, this weird confluence of the sacred and the mundane can be difficult to understand at first sight; and somewhat to difficult to process as well. The truth is that, however popular he may be, very, very few people on this planet fully understand who The Dalai Lama is, the true qualities of his character or the extent of his amazing strength and fortitude. While it may be tempting to have a somewhat dismissive view of a person in position, The Dalai Lama has maintained an amazing schedule of discipline, self-sacrifice and honor since earliest chidlhood. He also manifests an intense, tangible embodiment of Wisdom and Compassion and speaks from a place of deep empathy and understanding. </p>

  <p>Since the establishment of life in Dharamsala, His Holiness has busied himself constantly with both the running of his country in exile and the spreading of the Buddha Dharma around the globe. He works tirelessly for the benefit of beings and is both a prolific writer and public speaker. His many books include subjects that span from the nature of consciousness and the union of Eastern and Western science, to the most esoteric of Buddhist subjects to the most mundane, fundamental and simple advice on how to live a better life. He also has the distinction of being the first incarnation of the Dalai Lama to travel to the west and is known for his remarkable openness to different cultures and ways of life. He also has a deep interest in the workings of Western science and is regularly invited to scientific conferences and events both as a guest speaker and participant in discussions.</p>



<p>Despite the tragedy and loss He has experienced in his life, His Holiness’s devotion to his role as both the spiritual leader of Tibet and a messenger of Wisdom and Compassion to the world has remained unwavering. He is not only a wealth of knowledge in regard to how to live a balanced, peaceful and beneficial life but is also an embodiment of the principles He endorses. He is known for his humor and curiosity as well as his deeply logical and equanimous approach to the problems facing humanity and the world at large. His wide interest in the world and his openness to traditions beyond His own reinforce His ability to understand and speak with different peoples in modern times with a skill and insight that transcends the ordinary.</p>
<p>He is a teacher who lives and teaches by example. And it is largely this amazing quality of walking the walk combined with his penetrating wisdom and embodiment of the Buddha Dharma that has made him such a powerful presence in the world.</p>
