  <p>In recent years His Holiness The Dalai Lama has become quite famous around the world as something of a monastic celebrity. This meeting of ancient eastern tradition and online, 24/7 pop-culture is entirely unprecedented and something that can be difficult to understand at first sight. Very, very few people on this planet fully understand who The Dalai Lama is nor the true qualities of his character or the extent of his amazing strength and fortitude. While it may be tempting to have a somewhat dismissive view of a person in position, The Dalai Lama has maintained an amazing schedule of discipline, self-sacrifice and honor since earliest chidlhood. He also manifests an intense, tangible embodiment of Wisdom and Compassion and speaks from a place of deep empathy and understanding.</p>
  <p>In reality, while The Dalai Lama may be known by the majority as simply a name in the media, he in fact embodies an exceedingly rare combination of cultivated wisdom and skillfuls means that he works tirelesslly to share in the most selfless way possible. The man is busy literally from dawn to dusk and has been so since he was a very young child. While his reputation may precede him, it would be advised you listen to his words and contemplate their meaning with a special kind of care.</p>
  <p> And so, what, you may ask, does this rare and devoted teacher have to share?</p>
