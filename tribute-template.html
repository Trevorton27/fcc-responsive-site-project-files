  <p>In recent years His Holiness The Dalai Lama has become quite famous around the world as something of a monastic celebrity. This meeting of ancient eastern tradition and online, 24/7 pop-culture is entirely unprecedented.  Today, we can hear mention of the Dalai Lama or even see his picture or him talking on the television only to be followed immediately by a commercial for Mcdonalds or an update on some bizarre celeberity of the week drama. Yes, this weird confluence of the sacred and the mundane can be difficult to understand at first sight; and somewhat to difficult to process as well. The truth is that, however popular he may be, very, very few people on this planet fully understand who The Dalai Lama is, the true qualities of his character or the extent of his amazing strength and fortitude. While it may be tempting to have a somewhat dismissive view of a person in position, The Dalai Lama has maintained an amazing schedule of discipline, self-sacrifice and honor since earliest chidlhood. He also manifests an intense, tangible embodiment of Wisdom and Compassion and speaks from a place of deep empathy and understanding. </p>

  <p>In reality, while The Dalai Lama may be known by the majority as simply a name in the media, he in fact embodies an exceedingly rare combination of cultivated wisdom and skillfull means. And he works tirelesslly to share his knowledge and experience the most selfless way possible. The man is busy literally from dawn to dusk and has been so since he was a very young child. His reputation precedes him and for very good reason. It would be advised you listen to his words and contemplate their meaning with a special kind of care. He is, after all, a teacher who literally lives for his students. As the 13th Incarnation in the lineage, his only reason for being reborn in this age is to preserve, cultivate and pass on the timeless and universal Wisdom and Compassion of the Dharma. He is an inspiration to many millions of people and a great contributor to the peace and welfare of humanity.</p>
  <p> And so, what, you may ask, does this rare and devoted teacher have to share? What makes him so special and adored. To answer this would take volumes and a deep venture into the Buddhist Canon; far more than this simple page will allow for. Suffice to say that, as the leader and head of all the Tibetan schools of Buddhism, The Dalai Lama's message essentially focuses on compassion, altruism and kindness.</p>
    <p> For a glimpse into his unique and caring approach to our strange and unpredictable existence as human beings, please read the quotes below to gain a deeper understanding of how he views the world and our place in it.</p>

  <h2><strong>Precious Words For Trying Times: Words of His Holiness</strong></h2>
  <p id="quotes">"The goal is not to be better than the other man, but your previous self."</p>
<p id="commentary"> In other words: don't focus on overcoming the accomplishments of those around you. Focus on bettering yourself. While many may believe that the main practice of monastics in the Buddhist tradition involves avoiding the world and essentially meditating all day to "shut it out" and so on, this is actually a grave misconception. The real goal of Buddhist training, at least in the tradition from which the Tibetan schhools derive, is the perfection of your most beautiful qualities in order to empower you to help others do the same. And this is exactly why His Holiness works so tirelessly travelling the world, writing, praying and speaking; not to distance himself from the prolems and strife of our times but to bring himself closer to it and to show a path by example.</p>

  <p id="quotes">"Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions."</p>
<p id="commentary">In other words: the quality of the elements in our life, both internal and external, are the direct result of causes put into effect by what we do; not be what we want. While we may genuinely believe that what we do is directly related to what we want there is, infact, a sublte disconnect at play between the subjective state of our minds and the objective effect of our actions. This is largely why Buddhism considers the emotional states of Ignorance (lack of understanding of cause and effect), Aggression (anger and the desire to dominate and destroy) and Attachment (greed and desire) as "Three Poisons". Just like real poison, thes three emotional states, whether in combination or independently, can undermine our success by destroying the causes for it to come about.</p>
<p id="commentary">Think of the businessman who, in seeking his riches with greed and attachment, destroys the relationships he has with those in his life only to end up alone, despised and, much to his dismay, poor; all that destructive recklessness and obsession, all that planning and work, all that dreaming and chasing only to end up worse off than he was before and that much closer to the end of his life. There are many examples of things like this in our world. But, of course, most of them are far more subtle and internalized than we realize. They are also generally clouded by a very dense and persistent kind of ignorance which obscures them from our knowing.
So, in saying that “happiness is not something ready made” , His Holiness is referring to the fact that conditions and states do not simply fall out of the sky but are, instead, the direct result of contributing causes. And that we actually do have control over what comes to us if we know how to go about it without literally  poisoning ourselves.

  <p id="quotes">"We need to learn to want what we have, not to have what we want, in order to get stable and steady happiness."</p>
<p id="commentary">In other words:there is no end to the pursuit of conditions we believe will bring us happiness. We get the job, the car, the shoes we wanted. We get the girlfriend or the boyfriend. We get the new phone. We get attention from somebody we respect, a compliment from someone who is attractive to us. A deal on lunch. We feel a sense of satisfaction even if only briefly. And there is the hook. Satisfaction is impermanent. And so is the sense of elation and what we perceive as happiness in getting what, at the moment, we want. But then it passes. The new phone is not so new. The new partner not so fun anymore. The new job is now just work. And so we move on to the next thrill, the next rush of satisfaction in getting what we want.</p>
  <p id="commentary">This is not to downplay our sense of appreciation for things and the effort we put toward attaining what we want. It is not to brush it aside as a meaningless waste of time. Surely, there are sometimes very descent and even noble qualities to be cultivated in our pursuit of worldly affairs. It is certainly not always the case but it is often so that those who have really worked to get to high and respected positions in life (and worked in an altruistic way) have also cultivated along the way an immense amount of respect and admiration from others. They often have also cultivated a profound sense of character, kindness and gratitude.</P>
<p id="commentary">So, while it is perfectly acceptable that we pursue our livelihood in the world and its associated material and emotional comforts, we must also keep a sense of balance and perspective if we are to actually enjoy the results. Focusing purely on acquisition and getting, only on how to get more and more as if there can never be enough cultivates an insatiable sense of desire and dissatisfaction that, by its very nature, can never, ever be satisfied. Gradually but inevitably, this quest for more and more actually leads us away from happiness. While we may honestly believe happiness is just around the corner our profound sense of desire and ignorance only pushes us onward in a frenzy of grasping and clutching with no final end. It is, essentially, a backwards way of approaching things. To simplify and enjoy things while continuing to work hard and to be of benefit will surely bring us more than enough in the way of material comfort, no? So, what the Dalai Lama is saying here could be also be put as “Why not devote a little more energy to gratitude and appreciation to what you have than to getting what you want?”

     <div id="margin"></div>
  <p id="quotes">"If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice compassion."</p>
<p id="commentary"><strong>In other words:</strong> This line speaks to the radiant, expansive and impersonal nature of compassion. Compassion is simply compassion. If your heart and mind are filled with it there can be no other feeling. Just like a candle instantly expels darkness so too does compassion.
Compassion can make us happy simply by outshining anything else. It can also cultivate tremendous benefit for both ourselves and others because when we feel compassion, all that we think, say and due is infused with it. We stop harming and begin to benefit everything around us. All the beings and all the conditions. It’s literally like changing the channel in our minds and instantly becoming a positive force. It does not have to be dramatic and emotional or something over the top like in a movie. It can simply be a warm subtle, presence that is just there inside you radiating out in all directions internal and external.</p>

<p id="commentary">There are many in Buddhism who believe that all the good in the world actually comes from compassion while all the bad comes from a lack of it. It is that powerful. Think for a moment of all the conditions that exist around us to facilitate our happiness: streets to walk on, clean water to drink, clean air to breathe, food in the store, a bed to sleep in, a house to stay in, education to open our minds, free access to information and ideas. While we may think the presence of these things to simply be the norm as if they were no different from rocks and trees, the truth is they are the result of the compassionate efforts and contributions of countless millions of other beings that have lived, struggled and died over the millennia. So, if we are able to tap into this principle of radiant compassion even just a little bit we will certainly, even if only in a subtle way, immediately benefit ourselves. And the more we can practice compassion the stronger the connection will become and the more will be the benefit both to ourselves and others.</p>
<p id="commentary">As an example, look at the Dalai Lama. Everywhere he goes, hundreds of thousands of people come to see him, to listen to him, to hear his voice to catch just a glimpse of him or just to know that he is nearby. Why is that? There has to be a reason. And the reason is compassion is a universal quality and it is immensely powerful. It is the power of The Dalai Lama’s compassion that draws so many near him. They can feel something beautiful and good and they want to be close to it.</p>

  <h2>Thoughts</h2>
  <div id="margin"></div>
  <p id="commentary"> Admittedly, while the principles discussed above may be remarkably simple and clear they are, in reality, anything but easy to embody. Our negative habits of mind and tendencies of action are generally quite strong. However, we as human beings are endowed with a remarkable ability to assimilate and learn and to develop in, really, any direction we choose. What is learned can be unlearned, what is beneficial can be taught and the only constant is change. This is part of what makes our world such a varied and wonderous place but also so troubled and confused, too. It is not for lack of ability that we suffer but for ignorance of our own power.</p>
  <p id="commentary">In the Buddhist tradition, while some teachers may be so realized and powerful that we wonder how they ever could have been just a normal human being, it is adamantly maintained that even the greatest of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas was, at one time, just that: a normal human being. So, while, yes, the thought of changing our hearts and minds and evolving to a state where we can literally bring nothing but benefit to beings may seem daunting, it is vitally important to remember, even if only dimly at first, that it is possible. And not only possible but perhaps not so distant a dream as the apparent state of the world would have us believe. For, underneath it all, human beings are intensely communal, vulnerable and precious. They are capable of immense feats of both kindness and cruelty; creation and destruction with no one being more difficult than the other. The only difference is the result our actions incur and how we understand what it is we are doing. And this is why the teachers remain. This is why they live for others. And this is why they will never stop teaching and never stop working for us.</p>
